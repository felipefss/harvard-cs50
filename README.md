# Harvard CS50

This is my repository with all my solutions to the projects made in CS50 class (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)

In the `labs` folder you will find the solution to the labs, which are easier and quicker problems to solve, in order to fully grasp what was taught in that particular week.

Each `pset#` folder contains the resolution of a week's set of problems, which could be the equivalent of a graded project.

**OBS: _Please, note that the sole purpose of this repository is to share my solutions to the course coding challenges. All this material was obtained in the Harvard CS50 course's website. I am not the owner of the material and don't answer for Harvard, so if you want to copy or use it, please refer to https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/license/_**
