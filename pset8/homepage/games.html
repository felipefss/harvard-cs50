    <h2 class="text-center">Video Games</h2>
    <p>Another of my great hobbies (which, if I'm honest, I haven't been able to keep up too much lately) is
    playing video games. There's nothing like being "immersed" into another world for a few moments. Of course
    you can do that with a book as well, but you can't really control what happens in a book :)</p>
    <p>Here I'm displaying a list of my 10 favorite games (or franchises) of all times and my score to each of them:</p>

    <table class="table table-striped">
        <caption>* My all time favorite</caption>

            <tr>
                <th>Game</th>
                <th>My score</th>
