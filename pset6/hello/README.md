# Hello

Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

```
    $ python hello.py
    What is your name?
    David
    hello, David
```

## Specification

Write, in a file called `hello.py` in `~/pset6/hello`, a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in [Lab 1](../../../labs/lab1/), except that your program this time should be written in Python.

## Usage

Your program should behave per the example below.

```
    $ python hello.py
    What is your name?
    Emma
    hello, Emma
```

## Testing

While `check50` is available for this problem, youâ€™re encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

*   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `David` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, David`.
*   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Brian` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Brian`.
